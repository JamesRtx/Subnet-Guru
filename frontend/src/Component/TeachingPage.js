<h2 className='Subsectiontext'>Basic understanding of Ipv4 addressing</h2>
<p className='paragraphtext'>At its most basic level, an IP address is just a series of 1s and 0s, or bits, that computers understand. 
    These 1s and 0s represent electrical signals where a "1" is a higher voltage, and a "0" is a lower voltage. However, dealing with long strings of 1s and 0s isn't practical for humans, 
    so we represent IP addresses in a more readable form known as <b>dotted decimal notation.</b>
    <br/>
    An IP address consists of 32 bits (1s and 0s), which we break down into four groups of 8 bits, known as octets. Each octet is converted into a decimal value ranging from 0 to 255. These four decimal values are then separated by dots, giving us a more readable IP address.
